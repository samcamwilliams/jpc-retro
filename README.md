jpc-retro
=========

An earlier version of JPC, before everything was configurable and used the MISP language. Still quite useful, but less expressive. Key bindings and functions require recompilation of the system in this (the retro) version.

## Usage ##

* Customise the system and key bindings.
* Build with netbeans.
* Install the executable as you see fit, it is standalone.
* Run JPC-retro and type `help<enter>`. This should help you get to grips with the key bindings.

## Future Work ##

None.

All future development will take place on the MISP JPC version, this version is provided because it is vastly simpler than the current one.
